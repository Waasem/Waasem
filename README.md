- 👋 Hi, I’m @Waasem
- 👀 I’m interested in (Supervised) Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Graph theory.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning robustness of neural networks and graph theory applications in machine learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on graph theoretic concepts such as Ollivier-Ricci Curvature, Wasserstein distance, and study robust neural networks.
